# Overview

Hello-World is a simply python program that prints "Hello World." The difference between this and a standard Hello World program is that implements a "if __name__ == '__main__'" practice. It also states what age I am currently (using datetime).

I wanted to create this program as a sort of introduction to me as a Computer Programmer and to say who I am and how old I am. I am trying to further my learning as a data scientist within python, but I am also trying to expand my knowledge of other areas such as networking and Java.
